#                                                                                 #
#    The goals of this Easy-YouTube-DL script are:                                #
#                                                                                 #
#     1)  To have a thinly veiled excuse to learn and practice as many            #
#          bash scripting concepts as I can force into what started as            #
#          a six line script that probably should have stayed that way.           #
#                                                                                 #
#      2)  Maybe actually assist users who are CLI-phobic, primarily on           #
#         macOS, to download, install, and use youtube-dl with as                 #
#          little, or as simple, command line interaction as possible.            #
#                                                                                 #
#      3)  Finally publish some original code in open source for public           #
#          benefit, constructive critique, or vehement ridicule.                  #
#                                                                                 #
