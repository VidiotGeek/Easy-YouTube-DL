# Easy-YTDL

## About
This started as a simple script to make the great command line utility [_youtube-dl_](https://yt-dl.org/) easier to use for GUI-centric CLI-phobic users. Folks who wouldn't have a _clue_ what to do with a terminal window in front of them. The idea being, if the sight of a command prompt doesn't **immediately** scare them away, all the user would have to do is paste the URL into the prompt when asked. No having to remember to put it in "quotes" or otherwise having to understand anything about escape characters for the "?" and "=" present in URLs.

It turned into an excuse for me to practice as **many** bash scripting concepts as I could and is now _kind_ of a full download and install assistant for youtube-dl; in addition to it's original function as a very stripped down interface for it.

I realize that my would-be target audience are highly unlikely to know what [Github](https://github.com/) is,
but perhaps you also are the go-to tech support person for many of the people in your life. Maybe this is just the thing for you to use to assist those people in their legal, fair use, downloading of youtube clips.

I hope you find it useful in some way.

**Thanks!** \
Matt Bailey
